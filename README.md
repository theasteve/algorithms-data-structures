# Data Structures and Algorithms implementation in Ruby & JavaScript

I'm currently studying [Robert Sedgewick's Algorithms, 4th Edition book](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/).
The book is written in Java so in order for me to have a deeper understanding
I'm implementing the solutions on Ruby and JavaScript. Other implementations
have been on my own like Linked List.

I'm also going over [Rob Edwards professor at San Diego State University Data
Structure and Algorithms implementations on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/user/RobEdwardsSDSU/featured)

Big shout out to Robert Sedgewick and Rob Edwards for being amazing at their
craft. THANK YOU.
